<h1>TEXT</h1>
<p><strong>Friday</strong> November 12, 2021. Brownsville, TX. It was a warm, muggy night. An exhausted budding
programmer sits at his makeshift desk - a coffee table and yoga bolster. He's tired, exhausted, his back is killing him,
and he has more FOMO than anyone in the world has ever had, thanks to the party happening downstairs. He stubbornly
refuses to join the party, because he'd rather his homework be done.</p>
<br>
<p><blockquote><em><strong>FEED US!</strong> The dogs bark at him as he sweats the minute, meaningless details of his project.
  "It's past our dinner time and we are starving. We're also missing the party downstairs. FEED US AND LET US SAY HELLO TO
  OUR GUESTS"</em>
</blockquote></p>
<br>
<p><strong>FINE.</strong> The programmer agrees to go downstairs, feed the dogs, and socialize with his guests.
  But before going downstairs, he pauses to have a beer. He needs some liquid courage to use his awful Spanish.
  He finds it hard to believe you can grow so close to a group of people without even speaking the same language. As the programmer finishes his beer and walks downstairs,
   he promises himself after he learns to talk to computers, he'll learn to talk to his Mexican family too.</p>
